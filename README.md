# Learn Async

I have lofty goals for this app. I built it using React, Redux, and a bit of Immutable.JS.
This app will allow you to create your own async scenarios and get a feel for the
nature of asynchronous operations.

I'd love feedback on how I could make this useful. I'm thinking about:
  - displaying the correlating code (with an API switch.. see it in promises, jQuery,...)
  - adding 'then' and 'catch' logic so it skips then blocks on a fail and crashes when there is no catch (going for realism)
  - adding URL fields so we can actually send an API call and getting the data back (could help in bringing more significant context to chaining)
